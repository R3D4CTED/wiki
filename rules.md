## **Rule 1: No "WCIF" submissions outside the megathread.**

---

In order to reduce spam on our subreddit, all "where can I find?" submissions must be posted within the megathread.

*Failure to abide by this rule will result in a temporary ban from the subreddit.*

&nbsp;

## **Rule 2: No duplicate posts.**

---

Topics that have been recently or frequently discussed or that can be answered by reading the index will be removed.

&nbsp;

## **Rule 3: No linking to copyrighted materials.**

---

Direct links to streams, torrents, downloads, and file hosting services are not allowed. All communities on Reddit are obligated to abide by Reddit's content policy. These are non-optional policies that are enforced on every subreddit. The [reddit content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) explicitly states:

  > **Rule 7:**
  > 
  > Keep it legal, ***and avoid posting illegal content*** or soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.

This means despite being a piracy subreddit, we must have strict restrictions in place regarding what sort of content is not allowed. Most notably, this means that links to pirated content are off-limits.

Below are some examples to help you understand what content will and will not be removed. This list is ever expanding and should be checked frequently for updates.

**What is allowed?**

- "It's on Nyaa, the ID is 123456."
  - This is allowed because it is merely a reference to a torrent ID. It does not link to pirated material.
  

- "It's on animesite"
  - This is allowed because it is merely a reference to a torrent ID. It does not link to pirated material.
  

- "It's on animesite"
  - This is allowed because it is merely a reference to a website.
  

- "It's on animesite.com"
  - This is allowed because it is merely a reference to a website.
