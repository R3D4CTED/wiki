This wiki is written using [Reddit-flavored Markdown ](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown) but styled based on [Wikipedia's Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English).

When adding new content, please try to follow the style format that is currently being used (use the links above for references). When unsure, check out Wikipedia's style guide linked above, there are plenty of examples how stuffs should look like, that it should be adequate to cover most if not all the possible cases one might think of when adding new contents to this wiki without even have to actually read their guideline.

Few things to note about Reddit's Markdown:

- When using an ordered list (numbers), any sublist will automatically be an ordered list as well, no matter what you do. The same applies for an unordered list (bullet points). I haven't found any workaround for this so far.


- Make use of double line breaks to make the lists feels more spacious, especially on lengthy ones. The example is right here in this bullet point list. This method is preferred over the use of backslash `\ \` for Old Reddit compatibility. 


- Same thing applies to the use of `.` instead of `)` when defining an ordered list. Compatibility stuffs.


- For full information about content support difference between Old Reddit and New Reddit, refer to their wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown#wiki_differences_in_content_support_between_old_reddit_and_new_reddit) as well as their [Reddit-flavored Markdown guide](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown). Always choose the syntax with the highest compatibility.


Other notes:

- Reddit's content table indent absolutely sucks. To improve the navigation in the table, especially in a large guide with many sub-section level, use a `â–º` before the larger titles. Take a look at `torrent.md` as an example.


- If you don't want/need a sub-section to show up in the content table, don't use the `#` before the title.


- Add one `&nbsp;` at the end the content in every `.md` to make the EOF feels more natural visually.
