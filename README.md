# **Style guide:**

The style guide for the wiki is based on the [Reddit-flavored Markdown](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown).

&nbsp;

---

### **Headings:**

  > The main heading for each section should use one leading hash `#` as a level 1 header with content wrapped in double asterisks. Example:

  >  > `# **Header 1**`

### **Body:**

  > Smaller headings will typically use 3 leading hashes `###` as a level 3 header with content wrapped in double asterisks. Level 1 and level 2 headings don't have their font size difference distinguished enough. Example:

  >  > `### **Header 3**`

  > After each large section, e.g from 'Guide' to 'Troubleshooting', separate them by using `&nbsp;` and `---`. `&nbsp;` is used to force create a line break. Example:


```

`# **Guide A**`

`Foo text.`

`&nbsp;`

`---`

`# **Guide B**`

`&nbsp;`

```

  > To improve the raw format readability (no impact to the actual styling), add an extra empty line break after every block or line of text (like this current style guide you're reading opened it in raw format).

  > After each smaller headings, start a new text block using `>`. Example:

```

  >  > This is a new text block!

```

  > If there is a smaller sub-section, use another `>`. Example:

```

  > This is a text block!

  >  > This is the sub-text block!

```

  > For an unordered list, use `-` to start the line with a bullet point. Example:

```

  - This is point A.

  - This is point B.

  - This is point C.

```
  
  > For an ordered list, use a number (from 1 to n) followed with a dot. Example:

```

  1. I love cats!

  2. I like cakes!

  3. Don't change the order!

```
