## **Rule 3: No linking to copyrighted materials.**

  > Direct links to streams, torrents, downloads, and file hosting services are not allowed. These types of links violate the Reddit content policy and could result in the shutdown of our community. All communities on Reddit are obligated to abide by Reddit's content policy. These are non-optional policies that are enforced on every subreddit. The [reddit content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) explicitly states:

  >  > **Rule 7:**

  >  >  > Keep it legal, ***and avoid posting illegal content*** or soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.

  > This means despite being a piracy subreddit, we must have strict restrictions in place regarding what sort of content is not allowed. Most notably, this means that links to pirated content are off-limits.

  > Below are some examples to help you understand what content will and will not be removed. This list is ever expanding and should be checked frequently for updates.

  >  > ### **What is allowed?**

  >  >  > - "It's on Nyaa, the ID is 123456."
