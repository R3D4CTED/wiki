# **Auto-Downloading New Episodes via Torrent**

---

&nbsp;

In this guide, I will be using the qBitTorrent client and the HorribleSubs RSS feed, but the same process will apply to other clients/feeds as well.

**Preparations:**

1. Open up your torrent client. If you don't have an `RSS` tab next to `Transfers` and `Execution Log`, press `View` on the toolbar and make sure `RSS Reader` is checked.
   

2. Next, in that same toolbar go to `Tools` -> `Options` then switch to the `RSS` tab.
   

3. Check `Enable fetching RSS feeds` and set `Feeds refresh interval` to 15 minutes.
   

4. Check `Enable auto downloading of RSS torrents.`
   

5. Press `OK` and you're all set!

Next, choose the quality of the anime episodes that you are going to download and copy the corresponding link:

- 480p: [https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=sd](https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=sd)


- 720p: [https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=720](https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=720)


- 1080p: [https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=1080](https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=1080)

Do **not** paste this in a browser, since it will do nothing.

Over at your torrenting client, switch from the `Transfers` tab to the `RSS` tab. This is located right below the toolbar.

Next, press `New subscription` and paste the link you copied earlier into the newly appeared textbox. Press `OK`.

To set up the seasonal anime that you want to download, follow the steps below:

1. At the top-right of the RSS tab, press on the `RSS Downloader...` button.


2. In `Download Rules`, press the file icon (next to the trash can icon). A new textbox should appear. Type in the name of the anime you need to auto-download. For this example, I will do `Kimetsu no Yaiba`. Use only the Japanese title of the show, as HorribleSubs only offers the anime in their original title.


3. Once you've created the rule, change the textbox `Must Contain:` to the exact title of the anime you need to auto-download. Again, I will write `Kimetsu no Yaiba`.


4. Check `Save to a Different Directory` and then choose where you want the downloaded episodes to save.


5. Finally, check `HorribleSubs RSS` under `Apply Rule to Feeds`.


6. Wash, rinse, and repeat for every seasonal anime you want downloaded (steps 2-5).


7. Press `Close`.

You are done! Your favorite seasonal anime will now **AUTO DOWNLOAD** whenever a new episode is out. How cool is that?

**NOTE:** When you first add an anime to the list, the previous episodes may start downloading automatically. This only happens once, but you can always stop the download process from happening for each unwanted episode.

If you don't want to use HorribleSubs, you can use any other provider such as Erai-raws. Go into their website and check if they have an RSS menu. If they do, find the desired quality, then copy the link to their feed. You can continue from `New subscription` after you do that.

Happy pirating!
