# **Auto-downloading new episodes via Torrent**

---

&nbsp;

In this guide, I will be using the qbittorrent client and the HorribleSubs RSS feed, but the same process applies to other clients/feeds too!

**Preparations:**

  > 1. Open up your torrent client. If you don't have an "RSS" tab, then press **View** on the toolbar, then make sure "**RSS Reader"** is checked!
  > 2. Next, in that same toolbar go to **Tools -> Options** then switch to the **RSS** tab.
  > 3. Check **Enable fetching RSS feeds** and set the interval to 15 minutes.
  > 4. Check **Enable auto downloading of RSS torrents.**
  > 5. Press **OK** and you're all set!

Next, you're going to want to choose the quality of the anime episodes you want to be downloading. Then, with that quality in mind, copy the corresponding link.

480p: [https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=sd](https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=sd)

720p: [https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=720](https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=720)

1080p: [https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=1080](https://horriblesubs.info/rss.php?res=1080)

Go ahead and **copy** the link of the quality you want. Do **not** actually paste this in a browser, as that is useless.

Over at your torrenting client switch from the **Transfers** tab to the **RSS** tab. This is located right below the toolbar.

Next, press **New subscription** and paste the link you copied earlier into the textbox that should have appeared. Press **OK**.

To set up which seasonal anime you want to download, follow these steps:

  > 1. At the top-right of the RSS tab, press on the **RSS Downloader...** button.
  > 2. In **Download Rules**, press the green plus icon. A new text box should appear, so write down the name of the anime you want to auto-download new episodes of. For my example, I'll do "**Kimetsu no Yaiba"** (Demon Slayer). Only write down the Japanese title of the show, as HorribleSubs only offers the anime in their original title.
  > 3. Once you've created the rule, you want to change **Must Contain:** to the exact title of the anime you're wanting to auto-download. Again, I'll write "**Kimetsu no Yaiba**", WITHOUT the quotation marks.
  > 4. Check **Save to a different directory** and then choose where you want the downloaded episodes to save.
  > 5. Finally, check **HorribleSubs RSS** under **Apply Rule to Feeds.**
  > 6. Wash, rinse, repeat. For every seasonal anime you want downloaded, repeat steps #2-5.
  > 7. Press **Close.**

You're done! Your favorite seasonal anime will now **AUTO DOWNLOAD** whenever a new episode is out. How cool is that?

**NOTE:** When you first add an anime to the list, the previous episode may start downloading automatically. This only happens once though, and you can safely stop the transfer from happening, unless you actually want that episode downloaded too.

Also, if you don't want to use HorribleSubs, you can use any other provider such as erai-raws. Just go into their website and check if they have an RSS menu somewhere in there. If they do, find the desired quality, then copy the link to their feed. You can continue from **New subscription** after you do that.

Happy pirating!
