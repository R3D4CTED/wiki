# **How to bypass the Adblock ban in KissAnime**

&nbsp;

---

  > 1. Make sure you're using an [official site](https://www.reddit.com/r/KissAnime/wiki/kisscommunitylinks)!

  > 2. Clear your cookies. Some types of bans are cookie based.

  > 3. Download an adblock extension of your choice. [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation) is recommended.

  > 4. Download [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome, [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/tampermonkey/9nblggh5162s?cid=msft_web_collection&activetab=pivot:overviewtab)) or [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox).

  > 5. Install [this script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/4900-kissanime-anti-adblock-blocker).

***IF YOU WERE LOGGED IN WHEN YOU RECEIVED THE BAN MASSAGE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT A BAN WAS APPLIED TO YOUR ACCOUNT. WAIT UNTIL IT EXPIRES IN A FEW DAYS BEFORE LOGGING IN.***

***MAKE AN ACCOUNT ON MAL AND USE THIS EXTENSION (CHROME, FIREFOX) TO AVOID LOSING YOUR LISTS.***

If Disqus is being blocked, follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/KissAnime/comments/cdxkcp/cannot_login_into_disqus_to_comment_on_ka/etxwj10/). It should also work if the players are being blocked, but I haven't tested it because I have never had that problem.

If you want to use a free, safe VPN, use [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/). It claims that it does not collect any of your data and it is made by CERN. The Kiss sites do block the United States server, but none of the other servers are blocked. This can be used to get around Australia's ban on KissAnime and other streaming sites.
