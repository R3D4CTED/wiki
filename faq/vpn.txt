# **VPN FAQ**

---

### **Do I need to use a VPN for torrenting?**

  > If you are in a country (or have an ISP) that actively enforces copyright laws, it is highly recommended that you use a VPN while joining public torrent swarms.

&nbsp;

### **Do I need a VPN for streaming or DDL?**

  > It is highly unlikely to receive a DMCA (or equivalent) notice from streaming sites or DDL.

&nbsp;

### **Are there any good free VPNs?**

  > No. If you're not paying for the product, you are the product. Using free VPNs comes at the risk of having your Internet traffic logged and the possibility of receiving DMCAs.

&nbsp;

### **Is it safe to use a cracked/modded VPN?**

  > Absolutely not.

&nbsp;

### **What VPNs are safe for use?**

  > The only VPNs that should be considered safe are paid VPNs that claim that they do not retain logs. 

  > Make sure to do your research while picking a VPN provider. [That One Privacy Site](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/) is an excellent resource that breaks down VPN features and compares various VPN providers.

&nbsp;

### **Can I get a DMCA (or equivalent) while using a VPN?**

  > If you are using a paid VPN without logs, no. If you are using a free VPN or a VPN that retains logs, it is possible for your VPN provider to receive a DMCA (or equivalent) notice and forward it onto your ISP.
