### **Is torrenting illegal?**

Copyright organizations can send takedown notices to the internet service provider (ISP) of the file transfer participants and start lawsuits against them for infringement.

### **Who should I torrent from on nyaa.si?**

Torrenting from the green colored entries are encouraged since they are uploaded by trusted users. However, it does not always necessarily means that everything with green entries are the absolute best you can get. While it is subjective what quality one would consider it to be best in a torrent, if you want to find a good balance between everything, we suggest you to try:

- [SeaSmoke's Anime Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1emW2Zsb0gEtEHiub_YHpazvBd4lL4saxCwyPhbtxXYM/htmlview#)


- [A Certain Fansubber's Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJYwhjzLNPXV2X1np-S4rdZE4fb7pxp-QbHY1O0jH6Q/htmlview)

If you are in a rush, try searching for these terms `Erai-raws` or `Subsplease` for seasonal anime.

### **Why should I choose qBitTorrent over uTorrent?**

uTorrent has a poor track record among the torrent community for being nefarious by bundling the app with malware/spyware, tweaking things in user's PC without consent, and has a lot of ads. For those reasons, we suggest you to stay away and use [qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) (a free and open-source software) instead.
