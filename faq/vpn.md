# **VPN FAQ**

&nbsp;

### **What is a VPN?**

Virtual private network (VPN) is a service that gives you online privacy by masking your internet protocol (IP) address so that all of your online actions are virtually untraceable unless your VPN service provider keep logs - which we highly recommend you to stay away from such providers.

&nbsp;

### **What VPNs are safe for use?**

The only VPNs that should be considered safe are paid VPNs that claim that they do not retain logs.

Make sure to do your research while picking a VPN provider. [That One Privacy Site](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/) is an excellent resource that breaks down VPN features and compares various VPN providers.

### **Do I need to use a VPN for torrenting?**

If you are in a country (or have an ISP) that actively enforces copyright laws, it is highly recommended that you use a VPN while joining public torrent swarms. Unless you are confident that your local copyright law is lax, it is always better to use one as a safety measure.

&nbsp;

### **Do I need a VPN for streaming or direct download link (DDL)?**

Using VPN for streaming and DDL is usually not necessary unless you are coming from a place that blocks such sites. It is also highly unlikely you will ever receive a DMCA (or equivalent) notice for streaming or from DDL.

Please note that there are a few streaming sites (both official and non-official) that does not allow the use of VPN on their services.

&nbsp;

### **Are there any good free VPNs?**

No. Gambling with free VPN is highly discouraged. If you're not paying for the product, you are the product. Using free VPNs comes with a lot of risks and drawbacks:

- Your internet traffic is likely logged, which comes with the possibility of receiving a DMCA (or equivalent) notice.
- Very slow upload/download speed.
- Unstable connection.  
- Many free VPNs does not even allow torrent traffic.

 Buying a long-term VPN subscription can be as cheap as $3/month, so please help yourself. 

&nbsp;

### **Is it safe to use a cracked/modded VPN?**

Absolutely not. The cracked/modded VPN might be injected with foreign scripts (a disguised malware) that can modify or leak your personal information or data without consent.

&nbsp;

### **Can I get a DMCA (or equivalent) for using a VPN?**

If you are using a paid VPN without logs, no. If you are using a free VPN or a VPN that retains logs, it is possible for your VPN provider to receive a DMCA (or equivalent) notice and forward it onto your ISP.
