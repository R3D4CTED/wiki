&nbsp;

### **Who should I torrent from on nyaa.si for best subtitle and video quality?**

  > Generally, torrenting from the green colored entries are encouraged since they are from the trusted users. However, it does not always necessarily means that everything with green entries are the absolute best you can get. It is usually subjective what someone would consider the best for them, but if you want to find a good balance between everything, we suggest you to try the [Anime Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1emW2Zsb0gEtEHiub_YHpazvBd4lL4saxCwyPhbtxXYM/htmlview#) by u/-SeaSmoke-.

### **What are private trackers?**

  > [This](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Private_trackers) wiki page, originally written for 4chan's /g/ board, is a very good resource that explains private trackers in detail. Note that some of the information is out of date (for example, it states that applications are a viable path into AnimeBytes when they haven't accepted applications in years and probably never will again) but it's still a great resource.

&nbsp;

### **How do I join AnimeTorrents (AnT/AnimeZ)?**

  > AnimeTorrents usually has open signups once or twice per year, typically towards the end of the year around the holiday season. /r/opensignups is a good resource to figure out when they're open.

  > AnT also allows users to buy invites for their friends with bonus points but the page for sending invites has been broken for years and won't be fixed anytime soon.

&nbsp;

### **How do I join BakaBT (BBT)?**

  > BakaBT only allows new registrations from users who successfully pass an interview via IRC. The interview is mostly about the rules and information that you can find on their wiki.

&nbsp;

### **How do I join AnimeBytes (AB)?**

  > AB recruits from select few top tier trackers and also has user invites. 

  > RED is the only entry level tracker that AB recruits on and it is *extremely* difficult to survive on RED. The AB recruitment thread on RED requires you to be at least at power user (2 week old account, uploaded at least 5 torrents, 25GB uploaded, and >0.65 ratio) and your account must be at least 12 months old. If you were able to pass the RED IRC interview today, you would still have to wait over a year to join AB.

  > Users are responsible for who they invite on AB. The actions of the invitee can result in a ban for the inviter, as well as the entire invite tree, which results in people being unwilling to share invites. You should not consider user invites to be a valid path to AB.

&nbsp;

### **How do I join U2?**

  > U2 used to recruit on select Chinese trackers in the past and also has user invites. You should not consider user invites to be a valid path to U2.
