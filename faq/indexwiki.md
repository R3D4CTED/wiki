### **How do I request my site to be put on the [index](https://piracy.moe/)?**

You can do so by go to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/piracy) and fill in the form in the `#index` channel.

&nbsp;

### **Site X is dead, site Y is no longer ad-free but the index says otherwise. How do I suggest an edit?**

Same process applies, go to the `#index` channel [our Discord](https://discord.gg/piracy) and leave us a message.

### **I want to contribute to the wiki, where can I do that?**

Not just contributions, if you spotted a typo or wrong information, you can let us know either via mod mail, or go to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/piracy) and contact `Mint#0504` by ping or DM.
