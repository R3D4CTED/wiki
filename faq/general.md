### **How large a typical high quality 1080p anime episode should be?**

Tl;dr: expect 1 GB for a typical high quality anime episode (20-25 minutes). However, file size by no mean is a quality indicator.

1080p is just the resolution on the surface and file size is **not** a reliable indicator for video quality. The actual quality depends on the bitrate, which again depends on how it was encoded and the compression level. You can learn more how to detect video artifacts created by lossy compression [here](https://guide.encode.moe/encoding/video-artifacts.html). Bitrate is the biggest indicator of quality.

### **Why is the subtitle of this anime on streaming site X is so different from this torrent Y?**

Most (if not all) of the streaming sites content is a direct rip from the official source. Many torrents make their own subtitle (fansub) that has many great quality of life features that official subtitle lacks, such as special text effects, translated sign/note/text message, as well as better overall speech translation.

### **I have issue X with this streaming site/application, where should I seek for advices?**

Tech support discussions are typically only allowed in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/53EfBVH). If you can't find any help there, please refer to the FAQ section, github wiki, or contact the moderators/creators of such service/application you are using via their Discord (preferred), subreddit, mod mail, or email.

### **What are those weird strings of numbers I keep seeing?**

Similar to how nHentai entries are referenced by their ID, Nyaa entries can also be referred to by their ID.

### **{service/website} is blocked in my country/by my ISP, how do I bypass it?**

Not every block is implemented the same, so the only way to figure out is by trial and error.

- If it's a DNS-based block, you may have success by simply changing your DNS servers to ones that aren't controlled by your ISP.


- If it's a deep packet inspection (DPI) block, you may have some success with DPI circumvention tools such as [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI) or [PowerTunnel](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Android).


- Otherwise, a VPN with servers in a country without censorship blocks will usually work. [Refer to our VPN FAQ section for more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_vpn_faq)
