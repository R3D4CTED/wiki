# **General FAQ**

### **{service/website} is blocked in my country/by my ISP, how do I bypass it?**

  > Not every block is implemented the same so the only way to figure out is by trial and error.

  > If it's a DNS-based block, you may have success by simply changing your DNS servers to ones that aren't controlled by your ISP.

  > If it's a deep packet inspection (DPI) block, you may have some success with DPI circumvention tools such as [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI) or [PowerTunnel](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Android).

  > Otherwise, a VPN with servers in a country without censorship blocks will usually work. [Refer to our VPN FAQ section for more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_vpn_faq)

### **What are those weird strings of numbers I keep seeing?**

  > Similar to how nHentai entries are referenced by their ID, Nyaa entries can also be referred to by their ID.
