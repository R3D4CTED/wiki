### **{service/website} is blocked in my country/by my ISP, how do I bypass it?**


Not every block is implemented the same, so the only way to figure out is by trial and error.

- If it's a DNS-based block, you may have success by simply changing your DNS servers to ones that aren't controlled by your ISP.


- If it's a deep packet inspection (DPI) block, you may have some success with DPI circumvention tools such as [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI) or [PowerTunnel](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel-Android).


- Otherwise, a VPN with servers in a country without censorship blocks will usually work. [Refer to our VPN FAQ section for more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/animepiracy/wiki/faq#wiki_vpn_faq)

### **What are those weird strings of numbers I keep seeing?**

Similar to how nHentai entries are referenced by their ID, Nyaa entries can also be referred to by their ID.

### **How large is a typical high quality 1080p anime episode should be?**

Tl;dr: expect 1 GB for a typical . However, a file size is large does not necessarily mean that it has high quality.

1080p is just the resolution on the surface and file size is **not** a reliable indicator for video quality. The actual quality depends on the bitrate, which again depends on how it was encoded and the compression level. The two most common video compression codecs used to encode videos are H.264 and H.265 (also known as HEVC). H.264 is the older codec and plays better on older computers. H.265 is newer and has much better compression, meaning that it takes more power to decode but gives much better video quality at lower bitrates than H.264.

Lossy video compression codes such as H.264 and H.265 will typically create compression artifacts and trade off quality for file size. Lossless video compression codes such as H.264 Lossless, H.265 Lossless, and Motion JPEG Lossless will retain 100% of the video's information (color depth, bit depth, pixels, frames, etc.). You can learn more how to detect video artifacts created by lossy compression [here](https://guide.encode.moe/encoding/video-artifacts.html).

Bitrate is the biggest indicator of quality. For any two file using the same codec, a 2000Kbps bitrate file will always look better than a 1500Kbps bitrate file. This matters as much as, if not more, than the resolution per se. A 1080p video at low bitrate will generally look worse than a higher bitrate video at 720p. This is even more true for 4K resolution, where an 8 GB H.265 4K rip won't look any better than a same size 1080p H.265 rip and will most likely have more compression artifacts.
